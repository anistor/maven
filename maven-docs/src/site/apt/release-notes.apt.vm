Maven ${project.version}

  The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven ${project.version}.

  Maven ${project.version} is {{{http://maven.apache.org/download.html} available for download}}.

  Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model
  (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central place.

  The core release is independent of the plugins available. Further releases of plugins will be made separately.
  See the {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/index.html} Plugin List}} for more information.

  We hope you enjoy using Maven! If you have any questions, please consult:

    * the web site: {{http://maven.apache.org/}}

    * the maven-user mailing list: {{http://maven.apache.org/mail-lists.html}}

  For news and information, see:

    * Maven Dashboard: {{http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Home}}

* ${project.version} Release Notes

  The full list of changes can be found in our
  {{{http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=14118&styleName=Html&projectId=10500&Create=Create}issue management system}},
  and is reproduced below.
